PLANNING NETWORK MONITORING

To use this monitor, you'll need to install some dependencies first:

bash

pip install psutil python-nmap speedtest-cli scapy

This script will show you:

All devices connected to your network (IP, MAC address, hostname)
Current bandwidth usage
Active network connections and what programs are using them
Internet speed test results (runs hourly)

To run it:

Save the code to a file (e.g., network_monitor.py)
Open a terminal/command prompt
Navigate to the file's directory
Run: python network_monitor.py

*** 
Some features (like network scanning) may require administrator/root privileges to run.

Add more monitoring features?
Include data logging capabilities?
Add a graphical interface?
Include device blocking functionality?
