# Device detection and identification is a critical component of device management. The system must be able to detect new devices on the network and identify them based on their MAC address. This is necessary for tracking device usage and enforcing access controls. The following code snippet demonstrates how device detection and identification can be implemented in Python using the Scapy library:
