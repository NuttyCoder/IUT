Purpose and Usage

NetworkUtils:

Network scanning and device discovery
IP and MAC address management
Port checking
Used by the Device Control and Internet Tracking systems


SecurityUtils:

Password hashing and verification
Data encryption/decryption
Key generation
Used for securing sensitive data and user authentication


LoggingUtils:

Centralized logging system
File and console logging
Error tracking
Activity monitoring

EXAMPLE:
# Using NetworkUtils
from utils import NetworkUtils

# Scan network for devices
devices = NetworkUtils.scan_network()
for device in devices:
    print(f"Found device: {device['hostname']} ({device['ip']})")

# Using SecurityUtils
from utils import SecurityUtils

# Hash password
password = "mypassword123"
hashed, salt = SecurityUtils.hash_password(password)

# Encrypt sensitive data
key = SecurityUtils.generate_key()
encrypted = SecurityUtils.encrypt_data("sensitive information", key)

# Using LoggingUtils
from utils import LoggingUtils

# Initialize logging
logger = LoggingUtils()

# Log activities
logger.log_activity("Application started")
try:
    # Some operation
    pass
except Exception as e:
    logger.log_error(e, "Failed to perform operation")

 Integration Points
The utilities are used throughout the application:

-------->Device Control System:

from utils import NetworkUtils

class DeviceScanner:
    def scan_devices(self):
        return NetworkUtils.scan_network()

-------->User Authentication

from utils import SecurityUtils

class UserManager:
    def create_user(self, username, password):
        hashed, salt = SecurityUtils.hash_password(password)
        # Store user credentials

-------->System monitoring

from utils import LoggingUtils

class SystemMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = LoggingUtils()
        
    def monitor(self):
        self.logger.log_activity("Starting system monitoring")

*** These utilities provide essential functions that are used throughout 
the application, promoting code reuse and maintaining consistent 
implementations of common operations.
